 Now letâ€™s try to factorize sum and fact by introducing a new function, foldln f s n,
 where n is integer marking the end of our integer sequence. Try to understand what 
 f and s represent, and implement foldln; use it to re-implement sum and fact to check your results.

 Note: the following solution could be improved memory-efficiency wise using tail recursion.
