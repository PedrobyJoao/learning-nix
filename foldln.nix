/*
 Now letâ€™s try to factorize sum and fact by introducing a new function, foldln f s n,
 where n is integer marking the end of our integer sequence. Try to understand what 
 f and s represent, and implement foldln; use it to re-implement sum and fact to check your results.

 Note: the following solution could be improved memory-efficiency wise using tail recursion.

 **IMPORTANT**:
 foldln = foldl on n, n being a sequence of natural numbers

    /*
        The name of function `foldln`, the `l` is for *left*,
        meaning that the evaluation order of fold should start
        at the first elements (e.g.: 0 1).

        My previous implementation was a `foldrn`, starting
        evaluating from the rightest elements (the last ones) first.

        Note: although the following implementation is working,
        the order of evaluation is not correct.

        Let f = n: m: add n m

        Wrong evaluation order: (f 1 (f 2 (f 3 4)))

        Correct evaluation order: (f (f (f (f 0 1) 2) 3) 4) 

        Expanding on the correct evaluation order:

        foldln f 0 4 ==> (f (f (f (f 0 1) 2) 3) 4)

        stack:
        foldln f 0 4
        (f (foldln 0 3) 4)
        (f (f (foldln 0 2) 3) 4)
        (f (f (f (foldln 0 1) 2) 3) 4)
        (f (f (f (f 0 1) 2) 3) 4)

        sum_square:
        (f (f (f (f 0 1) 2) 3) 4)
